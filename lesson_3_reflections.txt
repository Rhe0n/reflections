When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you want other peoples input on your project. Or if you're working on multipe computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may always want to pull changes manually as you may not finish a change in one sitting. Meaning a half edited file will be uploaded to the remote for people to see which you might not want them to until its finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are complete copies of repositories within GitHub only. Clones are complete copies of repositories from GitHub to your local computer or just copies of repositories within your local computer. Branches are used within your repositorie to create different routes of code without effecting your master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit of having a copy is if any changes are made on the remote you can see the diff and merge if applicable.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would need to find another file sharing website or send multiple emails of your code/files in zip files to who you're wishing to colaborate with. I dont think this would be easier. Merge problems might not happen as often but there would be a lot more back and forth.
