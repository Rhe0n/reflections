When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you want other peoples input on your project. Or if you're working on multipe computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may always want to pull changes manually as you may not finish a change in one sitting. Meaning a half edited file will be uploaded to the remote for people to see which you might not want them to until its finished.
